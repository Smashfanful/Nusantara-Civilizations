Hail to you, illustrious Hayam Wuruk, radiant ruler of Majapahit! Born amidst the tumultuous times following the Yuan-Mongol invasion of Java, Majapahit rose like a phoenix from the remnants of the Singhasari Empire. Assisted by the valorous Gajah Mada and the skilled Laksamana Nala, you led Majapahit through the challenges of expansion and diplomacy. Your reign was a tapestry of triumph as you solidified Majapahit's stature in the region. Its dominion spanned across the lush islands of Java, Sumatra, Bali, Borneo, and more.  The realm flourished as a splendid hub of trade and culture, where art and architecture blended in exquisite harmony. It was an empire of splendor that shimmered like the tropical seas that embraced it. =

May the blessings of God be upon you, revered leader of Banten, Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa! Nestled on the verdant shores of the Sunda Strait, Banten stands as a bastion of maritime might and cultural richness. As a visionary leader, you skillfully navigated the complexities of geopolitics, forging diplomatic ties that safeguarded your realm's interests.

The bustling harbors and vibrant markets bore witness to the convergence of goods, ideas, and people, creating a mosaic of cultures that defined the essence of the sultanate. =

The blessings of God be upon you, Karaeng Matoaya, educated and reliable prime minister of Makassar. During your reign, Makassar was a busy trading post for various European and Asian nations. You also extended Makassar's military influence to the northern and central regions of Sulawesi, Buton, and Nusa Tenggara. Guided by your wisdom, Makassar made cannons and gunpowder, build new ships with more sophisticated designs, standardize trade currency, and strengthen forts on the coast of Gowa. But the empire fell at last under the assault of VOC-Bone-Buton-Ternate alliance =
